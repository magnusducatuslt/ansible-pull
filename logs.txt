ERROR! conflicting action statements: include_tasks, community.docker.docker_compose

The error appears to be in '/var/root/.ansible/pull/4.100.168.192.in-addr.arpa/local.yml': line 22, column 7, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  tasks:
    - include_tasks: tasks/cron.yaml
      ^ here
